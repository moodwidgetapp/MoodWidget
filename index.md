MoodWidget Privacy Policy

Overview  
MoodWidget allows users to log moods using widgets and optionally sync those entries to Apple Health (State of Mind). By default, all data is stored locally on the device and is not transmitted off-device.

Data Collected  
Mood selections and timestamps. No accounts, names, email addresses, or personal identifiers are required.

Health Data  
If enabled by the user, MoodWidget may write mood entries to Apple Health as State of Mind data. Health data is handled using Apple’s HealthKit framework and remains on the user’s device.

Data Use  
Data is used only to display mood history, streaks, and trends within the app. Data is not sold, shared, or used for advertising.

Storage & Retention  
All data is stored locally on the device. Data remains until deleted by the user or until the app is uninstalled.

Security  
Data is stored using iOS system protections. MoodWidget does not operate any external servers.

Non-Medical Use  
MoodWidget is intended for personal reflection only and is not a medical or diagnostic tool.
