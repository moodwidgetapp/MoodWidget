**MoodWidget Privacy Policy**

**Overview**  
MoodWidget allows users to log moods using widgets and optionally integrate with Apple Health (State of Mind). By default, all data is stored locally on the device and is not transmitted off-device.

**Data Collected**  
Mood selections and timestamps. No accounts, names, email addresses, or personal identifiers are required.

**Health Data (Apple Health / State of Mind)**  
If enabled by the user, MoodWidget may read and write State of Mind data from Apple Health using Apple’s HealthKit framework.

**Write**  
Mood entries logged in MoodWidget can be saved to Apple Health as State of Mind data.

**Read (Import)**  
Existing State of Mind entries from Apple Health may be imported into MoodWidget to populate mood history, charts, and trends.

**Authorization & Scope**  
Health data access is optional, explicitly authorized by the user, and handled entirely on-device. MoodWidget does not access health data without user consent and does not transmit health data off the device.

**Data Use**  
Data is used only to display mood history, streaks, trends, and visualizations within the app. Data is not sold, shared, or used for advertising.

**Storage & Retention**  
All data is stored locally on the user’s device. Imported Health data is copied into the app only to support visualizations and remains until deleted by the user or until the app is uninstalled.

**Security**  
MoodWidget uses iOS system protections and Apple’s HealthKit privacy controls. MoodWidget does not operate any external servers.

**Non-Medical Use**  
MoodWidget is intended for personal reflection only and is not a medical, diagnostic, or treatment tool.
